        <h1>Aalto Defense Hackathon</h1>
        <p>
            Created a working prototyper for a low cost passive survaillance system to detect and react to enemy movements. The consists
            of a grid of edge sensors placed along tree lines and fields. These edge sensors consist of a camera sensor,
            a low power computing unit such as a ESP32, battery and a radion transmission unit. When the sensor detects movement in the frame,
            it segemnts out the part where something moved and sends it through the mesh network to a main node located further away from the
            frontline. This main node has more computing power, and it will run the image through a computer vision algorith to detect what's in
            the image. If there is for example a soldier in that image, it will store that information, and eutomatically generate a report 
            about it based on a pre-defined structure.
