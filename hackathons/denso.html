        <h1>Denso Hackathon</h1>
        <p>
            We created a system to switch between charging different electric vehicles on a workplace based on their charging speed,
            arrival time, lenght of commute and potential special needs, such as a long trip, which would require full charge. 
            The system would use cameras to identify cars and which spot they parked in and use relays to switch the charging between 
            different cars, so that existing charging infrastructure could be used more efficiently.
