        <p>
            IN this project we used the data collected by Aalto University's space program combined with our best estimations of the properties
            of several plants to predict suitable areas and plants for carbon sinks. The estimates seemed to work decently, since at least 
            in Finland it suggested plants that are native in Finland.
