        <h1>Junction Main Event 2025, Bank of Finland challenge + SaS tech challenge</h1>
        <p>
            In this project we were provided 50 gb of textual data, containing legistlations from EU and Finnish laws, conserning financial sector. The challenge was to create a tool to sort through the data
            to find contradictions and overlaps in legistlations, and to specifically do so conserning specific risks that affect loan providers. We used multiple text processing methods on SaS Viya platform, combined with 
            methods such as word frequency matching and contextual embeddings in python to find potential pairs of legistlations which might overlap or contradict. Once we had narrowed the potential pairs down as much as possible, 
            we used an LLM model to compare the pairs and flag the ones with high likelihood of contradiction or overlap. We were only able to demosntrate our solution on a small subnset of the data, since we were running 
            the LLM model on a laptop, so we were only able to run the comparisons in the order of magnitude of tens per minute.
            <br><br>
            To be completely honest, I was super hesitant about us picking this challenge, going through gigabytes of textual data in a span of one weekend just didn’t sound like a great time, but the others insisted, 
            so off we went. Regardless of my doubts, we were able to return a suprisingly competent solution, which with proper polishing and sufficient funding for the computing power required could have actually
            been used for the task.
