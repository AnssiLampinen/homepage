        <h1>Sako Hackathon</h1>
        <p>
            In this hackathon we developed a AI powered targeting device for unguided anti-tank weapons. The device uses computer vision to identify the target and determine its' distance, speed and direction.
            This information would then be used to calculate the optimal aiming point for the weapon, taking into account the ballistics of the projectile, the movement of the target and environmental factors such as wind.
            I was responsible for the hardware side of the project, including sourcing suitable components, designing the circuit and assembling the prototype. I also contributed to the software side later on, but my main focus was on the hardware.
            Our team ended up getting outclassed in the competition, since most other teams were established defense sector companies or startups, but we got a lot of praise and a letter of recommendation from a judge, who took 'personal interest' in 
            our project. Overall it was a great learning experience and I was happy with our performance. Due to the feedback and genuine interest we received, we decided to continue developing the project after the event in our spare time.
