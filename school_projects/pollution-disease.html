        <h1>Pollution and Disease correlation analysis</h1>
        <p>
            In this project we analyzed the correlation between various air pollutants and different diseases. We used statistical methods to identify potential predictors of disease incidence based on air quality data. The analysis 
            involved collecting data from multiple sources, cleaning and preprocessing the data, and applying correlation analysis techniques to uncover significant relationships. We used data gathered from areas around USA, since it had the most 
            comprehensive datasets available.
