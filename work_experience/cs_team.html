        <h1>In game leader and manager of CS team</h1>
        <p>
            I played in a semi professional Counter Strike team for a little under 2 years. As I was the only one in the team who had serious 
            sports background, a lot of the admistrative responsibilities fell on me. On top of my in-game responsibilities, I handled
            our recruitment, sponsorhips and keeping the team together as kind of "coach". The latest of the three was especially challenging, as I had to
            hold together a team of 5 young and competitive guys with very different personalities in a highly stressfull environment. 
            I learned quite a bit about people management during that time and how to get different personalities to complement each other 
            instead of tearing each toher apart. Although not all of it is applicable in work life, I work a lot better in a team than 
            I did before. For the recruitment part, we changed 2 players during the team's exitence, on top of the 2 players we had to find 
            when establishing a team, and for these I went through over 100 applications and interviewed around 30 potential players in total, of which
            I suggested 2 or 3 for the rest of the team to consider as our next player for each position.
