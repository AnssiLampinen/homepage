        <h1>Industrial maintenance</h1>
        <p>
            Before beginning my university studies I worked on maintaining electrical, district heating and chemical plants, which I have since continued working as a summer job. 
            The company I work for focuses on heat and acid resistant refractory materials and their installation, and personally I have been working on the installation of these 
            materials in various industrial plants. These jobs are often really time sensitive, as the plants are only shut down for a short period of time, and the work must be
            completed within that time frame. This has taught me to work efficiently and effectively under pressure, as well as problem solving skills, as unexpected issues often arise during the work 
            and we might not have access to all the necessary tools and materials on site to solve the problems perfectly. On top of that the work has taught me resilience and teamwork, as the work is 
            physically demanding and the days and weeks are long, which tires the whole crew, making it crucial to work together and support each other to keep the morale up to get the job done safely and in time.
