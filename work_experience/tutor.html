        <h1>Math and Physics Tutor</h1>
        <p>
            I tutored high school students in math and physics, helping them improve their understanding of the subjects and achieve better grades.
            I developed personalized lesson plans and provided one-on-one support to address each student's unique needs, emphasizing problem-solving skills
            and conceptual understanding over quick solutions to the exercises. I really enjoyed the work, but eventually it became hard to manage the timetables
            of both my studies and tutoring, so I had to quit. Over my time as a tutor I helped around 25 different students with their studies, and got positive
            feedback mainly for my patience and ability to break down complex topics into simpler, more digestible parts.
